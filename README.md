# react-parcel-starter

Minimalistic React starter package using Parcel instead of create-react-app or Webpack. Slim and trim, without the massive overhead.

`npm install` after copying repo.

`npm run dev` to start local dev server.

`npm run build` to build out assets into `dist` folder for production/deployment.
